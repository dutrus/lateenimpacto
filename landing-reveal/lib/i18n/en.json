    "subtitle": "How was Lateen Impact born?",
    "intro": {
      "p1": "Lateen Impact was born in 2019 from the personal experience of its founder, Luc√≠a Mart√≠nez, who during her adolescence discovered almost by chance a scholarship that allowed her to study abroad and completely changed her educational and professional trajectory.",
      "p2": "Upon returning to Argentina, Luc√≠a realized that many talented young people with potential never got to know about opportunities that could transform their lives, simply due to lack of information or not knowing how to access them. Thus, the idea of creating a platform that would democratize access to these opportunities emerged."
    },
    "firstSteps": {
      "title": "The first steps",
      "p1": "What began as a simple blog and an Instagram account where Luc√≠a shared scholarships and opportunities she found, soon became an active community. Other young people who had participated in similar programs began to join as volunteers, contributing their experience and knowledge.",
      "p2": "In 2020, during the pandemic, the project took a significant leap: the need for information about virtual educational opportunities grew exponentially, and Lateen Impact responded by organizing webinars, creating detailed guides, and establishing a virtual mentoring system."
    },
    "growth": {
      "title": "Growth and evolution",
      "p1": "Over time, Lateen Impact evolved from being a simple dissemination channel to becoming a complete support ecosystem for young people seeking opportunities. We developed three fundamental pillars:",
      "pillars": [
        "Opportunity sharing: We expanded our coverage to include not only scholarships, but also competitions, leadership programs, exchanges, and more.",
        "Active community: We formalized our network of volunteers and mentors, creating spaces for exchange and mutual support.",
        "Content curation: We developed our own resources such as guides, templates, and practical advice to facilitate the application process."
      ]

    "impact": {
      "title": "Impact and results",
      "p1": "To date, Lateen Impact has helped more than 5,000 young people find and apply for educational opportunities. More than 500 of them have obtained scholarships or participated in international programs thanks to the guidance and resources provided by our platform.",
      "p2": "Our team has grown to include more than 30 active volunteers in different provinces of Argentina, and we have established alliances with universities, foundations, and educational organizations that share our mission."
    },
    "future": {
      "title": "Looking to the future",
      "p1": "Lateen Impact's journey continues. Our goal is to continue expanding our reach, develop technological tools that further facilitate access to opportunities, and create our own programs that complement existing options.",
      "p2": "We firmly believe that access to information and educational opportunities should not depend on chance or privilege. With each young person we support, we are building a more equitable future full of possibilities for everyone."
